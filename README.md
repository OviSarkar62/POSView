# POSView

This documentation outlines the details of a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Stack project. This project is a web application that allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) items. The application utilizes a RESTful API for server-side functionality and a single-page application (SPA) for client-side functionality.

## Requirements

To run this application, you will need the following:

- Node.js installed on your system
- MongoDB installed on your system or a MongoDB Atlas account
- Internet connection

## Installation

- Clone the project from the GitHub repository: 

      git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    
- Navigate to the project directory: 

        cd your-repo
    
- Install the dependencies for the server: 

    npm install
    
- Navigate to the client directory: 

    cd client
    
- Install the dependencies for the client: 

    npm install
    
- Create a .env file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

1. MONGO_URI: The connection string for MongoDB. If using MongoDB Atlas, you can find this in the cluster details.
2. JWT_SECRET: A secret key for JSON Web Tokens. This can be any string.

- Start the server: 

    npm run server
    
- In a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory:

    cd client
    
- Start the client: 

    npm start
    
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the application.

## API Endpoints

The API for this project is RESTful and provides the following endpoints:

GET /items: Returns a list of all items
POST /items: Creates a new item
GET /items/:id: Returns an item by ID
PUT /items/:id: Updates an item by ID
DELETE /items/:id: Deletes an item by ID
Each endpoint expects and returns data in JSON format.

Client-side functionality
The client-side of the application is a SPA built with React. The user interface provides the following functionality:

View a list of all items
Create a new item
Edit an existing item
Delete an item
The client utilizes Axios to make HTTP requests to the server-side API.

Security
The API is secured with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Each request to the API must include a JWT in the authorization header. The server-side code verifies the JWT before allowing the request to proceed.

Error handling
The server-side code includes error handling for common errors such as missing parameters or incorrect data types. Error messages are returned in JSON format.

Conclusion
This MERN Stack project provides a functional web application with CRUD functionality. The server-side API is RESTful and the client-side is a SPA built with React. The application is secured with JWTs and includes error handling for common errors.
